## About me

- A graduate at **Faculty of Economic Sciences** and **Faculty of Management** (University of Warsaw)
- Currently, a student of postgraduate studies in Big Data at **Warsaw University of Technology**
- Working as a **Quantitative Analyst** on FX trading desk in **mBank S.A.**
- I do code in **R** (mostly), **Python**, **Scala** 
- I use **RStudio** with **VIM**, and some other software, but rather rarely (e.g. **MS Visual Studio**, **Sublime Text**)

## Disclaimers

- **tidyr** is a very extensive set of packages. I'm going to present only a **fraction** of its functionalities, things I have found useful **and**/or interesting
- Most things I have learned are based on my trial-and-error approach, Google Groups, Stackoverflow, and articles I have faced
- Most things I have learned and I encourage you to do the same. Studies are useful, though!
- If you have any questions, feel free to ask



## packages I will use
* magrittr
* dplyr
* plyr
* purrr
* forcats
* ggplot2 (for viz)
* ... and some others



## magrittr

* Since few years **magrittr** has become a natural choice for writing code in R
* Instead of nesting a function into some another function, we can chain them
* The most important function is **%>%** but I also use **%<>%** and, rather rarely, remaining functions (such **%T>%**)
* Example:



```{r magrittr_example}
data("flights")
flights <- flights[flights$month>5, ] # normal mode
flights <- flights %>% .[.$month>5,]  # ctrl/cmd + shift + m for piping
flights %<>% .[.$month>5,] # super short expression with use of magrittr
flights %<>% .[.$month>1,] %T>% {print(head(.))} %T>% {flights_sample <<- sample_frac(., 0.01)} #variation

```



## dplyr

* **dplyr** is a package for managing **data frames**. It enables users to transform their data sets in such a way that it is 
efficient and easy
* dplyr has a very consistent grammar. After some training, most functions become very intuitive ( **\*_at**, **\*_if**)
* the most common functions are as follows:
    - filter() - for filtering data
    - slice() - for removing rows we don't want in the final data set
    - arrange() - for arranging a data frame by some variable. For instance, if we want to work on time series, but we
    don't want it to be a xts object (a matrix in its essence), we can arrange our data by some variable
    - select() - for selecting columns, the function is much more flexible and user-friendly, especially for beginners, than base R
  


```{r dplyr_example, include=T}
data("flights")
sprintf('%2d', 1000)
flights_sample <- flights %>% sample_frac(0.01)

f_time_to_POSIXct <- function(x){
  if(!is.na(x)){ res <- gsub('([0-9]?)([0-9])([0-9]{2})','\\1\\2\\:\\3' ,x = x, perl=T) %>%
      {paste(Sys.Date(), ., sep=' ')} %>% 
      as.POSIXct(origin='1970-01-01') %>%
      format('%H:%M')}else{
        res <- NA
      }
  return(res)
} 

flights_sample %>% mutate(
  dep_time = map(dep_time,function(x) f_time_to_POSIXct(x)) %>% flatten(),
  arr_time = map(arr_time,function(x) f_time_to_POSIXct(x))%>% flatten()
  )
map(flights_sample$dep_time,function(x) f_time_to_POSIXct(x)) %>% flatten()
flights_sample %>% group_by(month) %>% slice(1:2)
```

## dplyr

* the most common functions are as follows:
- distinct() - for changing a data set so that a given variable has only distinct values
    - mutate() (and transmute()) - sometimes more expressive way to do something
    - summarise() - for summarizing some values. The only constraint it always returns a single value
    - sample_n() (and sample_frac()) - a very useful function, the result is much easier to achieve than with base R
    - do() - a more **"pro"** function because it is not as constrained as e.g. summarize function. It's useful when you want to apply a model or quantiles (not a single value) to some subset of data
* Since version 0.6.0 (released exactly `r as.numeric(Sys.Date()-as.Date('2017-05-11'))` days ago), authors added new features for non-standard evaluation (NSE).
It's especially improtant for **R developers** who want to develop a production code. For academic research, it's probably neglible in most cases

```{r dplyr_do_example, include=T}
flights_sample <- flights %>% sample_frac(0.01)

flights_sample %>%
  group_by(month) %>% 
  do(quantiles=quantile(.$dep_delay,probs=seq(0,1,by=0.1),na.rm=T)) %>%
  unnest(quantiles) %>% 
  



```

## plyr

* plyr is much more general. It allows us to work with different (all) kinds of data with use of \*\*ply functions, such as:
    - aaply - requires array input, returns array output
    - dlply - requires data frame input, returns list output
    - m_ply - requires data frame with columns as arguments for .fun, returns nothing (but used for side effects)
* plyr is **way** more consistent than base R packages in terms of both used arguments and behaviour. It is also **faster**
and has **interesting features** (e.g. progressbar, backend for parallel processing)


## plyr Examples

```{r plyr_example, include=T}
data("flights")
flights_test <- flights %>% sample_frac(0.01)
### Data frame returning data frame
flights_test %>% ddply(.variables = .(year, month), .fun = function(x){ summary(is.na(x$dep_time)) })
year_month <- paste(flights_test$year,
      sprintf("%02.0f",flights_test$month), sep='-')  
#year_month%>% adply(.margins = 1, .fun = function(x){ summary(is.na(x$dep_time)) })
# Arguments in data frame returning array
maply(expand.grid(x = 1:5, y = 1:5),.fun = function(x, y){paste(x, y, sep='-')})
```


## purrr
* It's probably the least known package out of four I have shown you so far, but it's one of my favourites

## forcats
* Factors are stupid and most people do not like them
* They are especially messy for visualizations
* Helper for reordering factor levels
```{r forcats, include=T}

flights_test <- flights %>% sample_frac(0.01)
# Ain't cool
flights_test %>% 
  mutate(dest = as.factor(dest)) %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(n=n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=dest, y=n))+geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+theme_economist()
# Now with forcats
flights_test %>% 
  mutate(dest = as.factor(dest)) %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(n=n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=forcats::fct_reorder(dest, n,.desc = T), y=n, fill=n))+geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+theme_economist()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  labs(x='Destination', y = 'n')
